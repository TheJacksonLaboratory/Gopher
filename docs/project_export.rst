Exporting the project file
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Gopher supports collaborative work on probe panel designs by allowing project files to be exported and shared.


The project file can be exported (``File > Export project ...``) so that it can be imported on another computer.
The project file has extension ``.ser`` and contains all results and design settings.
Sharing the file enables users to share results without having to re-run the analysis.

When a new project is created, the project file is saved in the home directory in directory ``gopher``.
The user can select ``File > Save project`` at any time to write the current state of the analysis to the project file.
