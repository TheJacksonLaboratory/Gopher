A short introduction to Capture Hi-C
====================================

Chromosome conformation capture (3C) is used to analyze the spatial structure of chromatin, which plays an important role in regulation of gene expression. The next-generation sequencing (NGS) application Hi-C, a variant of 3C, allows the detection of all pairwise DNA interactions within the genome. Since the number of interactions is extremely large, Hi-C requires a very large amount of input DNA and has a relatively low resolution. Capture Hi-C (CHC) uses the hybridization capture technology to enrich viewpoints that are typically restricted to small regions surrounding the  transcription start sites (TSS). Similar to exome sequencing, sequencing libraries are enriched for viewpoint sequences using biotinylated cRNA baits. Capture-C and Capture Hi-C have been applied in different contexts to sets of promoters of a few hundred genes  as well as to the promoters of all human or mouse genes.
