A short introduction to Capture Hi-C
====================================

Chromosome conformation capture (3C) is used to analyze the spatial structure of chromatin which plays an important role in regulation of gene expression.
The next-generation sequencing application Hi-C allows the detection of all pairwise DNA interactions within the genome.
In order to derive valid interactions, Hi-C requires a large amounts of input DNA and deep sequencing.
Similar to exome sequencing, capture Hi-C (CHC) implements a compromise by limiting the view to preselected regions of interest using hybridization capture technology.
For instance, capture Hi-C can be used to restrict the analysis to interactions that involve promoter regions.
