Basic concepts and terminology
==============================

For Hi-C **restriction enzymes** are employed that cut the genome at specific nucleotide patterns. For instance, the enzyme
DpnII cuts at all occurrences of the pattern GATC. The resulting DNA fragments are referred to as **digests**.
The resolution of Hi-C is at the digest level, i.e. detected interactions are between digests,
which is why the target regions for capture Hi-C consists of digests.
Due to the Hi-C protocol the **baits** used for enrichment need to be placed within **margins** of only.
The efficiency of baits depends on a number of factors including reapeat and GC content.
Therefore, not all all digests can be **selected** for enrichment.
