# VPV
Viewpoint Viewer
A Java App designed to help design probes for Capture Hi-C. 
The VPV apps allows users to download, uncompress, and index genome FASTA files, which are used to calculate the size and repeat content of restriction fragments within candidate viewpoints. A list of candidate genes is uploaded to the App, and the app calculcates viewpoints and allows users to revise them using an interactive visualization.
